            "content": "This is an end-to-end tutorial on how to convert a PyTorch model to TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) using ONNX. Specifically, we will be using the CRAFT model (proposed in this paper) which is essentially a text detector. Following is the overview of what’s covered in the tutorial - . Brief Overview of Craft Model | TFLite Conversion Flow PyTorch Model to ONNX Model | ONNX Model to TensorFlow SavedModel | TensorFlow SavedModel to TFLite Model Dynamic Range Quantization | Float16 Quantization | . | . | Running Inference with TFLite Model | Conclusion | . Please open the notebooks included in this repository and follow along with this blog post. You may also directly download already converted TFLite Models from this repository. .",
