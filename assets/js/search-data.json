            "content": "This is an end-to-end tutorial on how to convert a PyTorch model to TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) using ONNX. Specifically, we will be using the CRAFT model (proposed in this paper) which is essentially a text detector. Following is the overview of what’s covered in the tutorial - . Brief Overview of Craft Model | TFLite Conversion Flow PyTorch Model to ONNX Model | ONNX Model to TensorFlow SavedModel | TensorFlow SavedModel to TFLite Model Dynamic Range Quantization | Float16 Quantization | . | . | Running Inference with TFLite Model | Conclusion | . Please open the notebooks included in this repository and follow along with this blog post. You may also directly download already converted TFLite Models from this repository. .",

My projects mainly focus on developing low latency models to be deployed in mobile devices or edge devices. . Before to that I worked in Mihup where I worked on Text to Speech and Speech Recognition Projects for edge devices. . In free time I like contributing to open-source recently started publishing models to Tensorflow Hub . Work Experience: .
